This is just a very small project I created to answer a nice job offer I had to decline.

The output will be:

```
Sorry I cannot apply because:
 - languages: Languages [en, it] don't contain all the required languages [en, de]
 - interests: Interests [TECHNOLOGY, MUSIC] don't match all the required interests [FUTURE_DEVELOPMENT_OF_HIGH_LEVEL_SPORT, TECHNOLOGY]
 - willingToRelocate: must be true
```
